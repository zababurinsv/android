# Headless Audio (HAudio) Extension

HAudio will enable bypassing the _WebView_ limitations in iOS
regarding audio recording.

This uses a similar API to [\$audio.record](http://jasonelle.com/docs/legacy/actions/#audiorecord)
but does not display a recording screen.

Instead uses an special event named `$haudio.onfinishrecording`.

See the `haudio.example.json` to see an example of usage.

## Installation

Just copy the directories `HAudioAction` and `HAudioService`
to your project files.

## Sponsor

This extension was developed thanks to the folks at
https://cloone.me

Special thanks to _John Mark_.
