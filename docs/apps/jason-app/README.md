# What is Jason?
<div class='huge'>{ ·ᴥ·}</div>

Jason is a single app that lets you summon and bookmark multiple Jasonette apps simply by entering the JSON url, <b>without building your own physical app or setting up development environment.</b>

It's good for using as a container for single purpose apps or quick disposable apps, prototyping, beta testing, etc.
