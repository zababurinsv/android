# README

This app demonstrates the [Jasonette demo app](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-build-cross-platform-mobile-apps-using-nothing-more-than-a-json-markup-f493abec1873#.3cgbjzx0t)

It utilizes Rails 5.0 and JBuilder to construct the same markup as the demo Jasonette app (with a Rails logo thrown in for good fun).

This project was produced on Friday, February 17, 2017, at a fairly early stage in Jasonette's life.
